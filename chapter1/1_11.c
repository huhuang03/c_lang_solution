/**
Testing the word count program involves, giving three kinds of inputs.
 1. Valid inputs.
 2. Boundary Condition Inputs.
 3. Invalid inputs.

For Valid Inputs, it cound be any stream of space separate text. It has valid space, newline and tab characters. For Boundary conditions, a file entirely consisting of n, or a file entirely consisting of t charater or a empty file.

For invalid inputs, an unclosed file which does not have EOF, which is tricky to provide can be given to this program. A unicode charater file can be given and see if getchar() hanldes property.
